        <p>
          This is the story of librarian Eleanor Thompson, who spent her entire life working as a librarian in the tiny town of Eldridge,
          far from the bustle of civilization. After sixty-five years of work, she finally retired and was able to pursue her passion:
          cross-stitching.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, every evening at sunset, Eleanor would settle into a velvet chair by the window, carefully placing the wooden frame on her lap,
          as if it were a precious manuscript. She quietly embroidered to the sound of soft music, and time passed unnoticed...
        </p>

        <p>
          The pattern she chose that fall was simply delightful: a blooming rose garden, embroidered with crimson, emerald, and gold threads.
          She loved it! With precise movements, Eleanor moved the needle across the fabric, creating tiny crosses that gradually formed a
          pattern. This work became a kind of meditation for her, aided by her patience and perseverance, honed over a lifetime of cataloging
          thick volumes.
        </p>

        <p>
          One evening, when the work was almost complete, a light knock on the door interrupted her solitude. It was her granddaughter, Lydia,
          visiting from the big city. Young Lydia, a researcher in digital archives, looked at the embroidery with interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          &quot;Listen, Grandma, it&apos;s just like your library&mdash;every cross stitch in its place, creating a whole!&quot;
        </p>

        <p>Come to think of it, Lydia was right, don&apos;t you think?</p>

        <p>
          I just hope that cross stitch doesn&apos;t disappear like the paper books Eleanor worked with, giving way to the digital ones Lydia works
          with.
        </p>

        <p>
          That&apos;s my greatest hope.
